# Game Development Document: Presto Framework

## 1. Vision & Overview
Develop a high-performance, extensible Sonic-style game framework in C23, focusing on fast-paced platformer mechanics, physics, and modularity for rapid prototyping and development.

## 2. Core Gameplay Mechanics
- **Movement:** High-speed running, acceleration, deceleration, jumping, rolling, and momentum-based physics.
- **Level Design:** Loop-de-loops, slopes, springs, platforms, and interactive objects.
- **Enemies & Hazards:** Modular enemy behaviors, collision detection, damage, and invincibility frames.
- **Collectibles:** Rings, power-ups, shields, and score tracking.
- **Camera System:** Smooth following, dynamic zoom, and parallax backgrounds.

## 3. Technical Requirements
- **Language:** C23 (latest C standard)
- **Graphics:** Raylib or similar cross-platform graphics library
- **Physics:** Custom 2D physics engine optimized for Sonic-style gameplay
- **Audio:** Modular sound and music system
- **Input:** Keyboard, gamepad, and customizable controls
- **Platform Support:** Windows, Linux, macOS

## 4. Framework Architecture
- **Entity Component System (ECS):** For flexible game object management
- **Scene Management:** Level loading, transitions, and state handling
- **Resource Management:** Efficient handling of textures, sounds, and assets
- **Scripting Support:** Optional scripting for rapid prototyping (Lua or similar)
- **Debug Tools:** In-game debug overlay, profiling, and logging

## 5. Art & Audio Direction
- **Visual Style:** Retro-inspired pixel art, vibrant colors, and smooth animations
- **Audio Style:** Upbeat, energetic music and classic sound effects
