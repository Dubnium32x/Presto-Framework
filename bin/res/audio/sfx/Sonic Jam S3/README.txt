Recorded on Bizhawk "Saturnus", by Chopp. Organized by (mostly) sound ID in Music Shop.

sounds under the "looping sounds" folder are IDs 135-168 in Music Shop, 
these are not trimmed for looping due to some having unique fadeouts.

by technicallity, the sounds start from index 0 in the Music Shop, but fast exporting made it start from 1.
